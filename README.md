Project to change the business model of a friend company and also using adding a new UX using Jekyll to generate more lead !

Multilingual landing page (english and french), I did for a friend in order to collect mail and generate new lead.
    
    
Since I have empty as much things as possible to make it load faster to run this code you need the following command :
```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
````

:warning: : do not hesitate to test ```$ jekyll build ``` and fix issues asap do save time when you deploy (mainly because of plugins and gem issues)
