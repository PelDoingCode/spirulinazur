## CMS

Jekyll Basics comes with [Jekyll+](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/jekyllplus) set up by default.

If you're on GitHub pages, you should be able to show the edit button by appending `?jekyllplus=true` to the URL. For example: https://wiredcraft.github.io/jekyll-basics/?jekyllplus=true

If needed, you can set it up manually at the end of the `_config.yml` file by setting
up the `jekyllplus` variable:

    jekyllplus: Wiredcraft/jekyll-basics/master

## need to run this if you want serve to work : gem install jekyll-sitemap
